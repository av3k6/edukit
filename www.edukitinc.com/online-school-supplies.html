                                <h2 class="title content purple">Online Back to School Shopping</h2>
                                <p class="description">Back-to-school season. The aisles of stores are filled with shelf after shelf of folders, pencils, binders, markers, and a seemingly unending list of other supplies. The variety of supply options may seem excessive to someone on the outside looking in, but every parent and teacher knows that it would actually be a miracle to find all the supplies on a list at one store. This is because every school and each grade have unique supply lists created to fit their curriculum. When it comes to running a classroom, customizing a school supply list can help with lesson planning, classroom organization, and efficiency. When it comes to purchasing those supplies, however, having several customized supply lists can be a nightmare for any parent. Before it was possible to purchase school supplies online, parent’s would often go to multiple stores in order to find all the items on a supply list at a decent price due to low inventory at certain stores or specific items.</p>
                                <p class="description">Purchasing school supplies online is a great way to make the process easier, but it does not completely eliminate the hassle. In some cases, it can still require shopping at a number of places online, waiting for multiple shipments, and buying more of something than you need in order to get the exact supply that is on the list. Teachers often discover that haggard parents give up on finding the exact supplies and make their own substitutions. This can be frustrating for the kids that do not have the correct supplies and impede the teacher’s ability to move forward with planned activities. Thankfully, there is an easier way to order school supplies online in order to get students the supplies they need – <a href="index.html">school supply kits from EduKit.</a></p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="supply-kit-info information">
                                <h2 class="title content purple">What is a school supply kit?</h2>
                                <p class="description">The school supply kits from EduKit are specially crafted directly from the unique supply lists of teachers at a school. EduKit can <a href="program.html">customize a kit for any supply list</a>. If your teacher lists include folders that are specific colors, pencils that are a particular brand, or other hard to find art supplies – Edukit has you covered. This is not a generic school supply kit that any parent can order online – it is 100% tailored to the supply list provided by schools.</p>
                                <p class="description">Because each EduKit is customized, getting your classroom set up requires collaboration between EduKit and a school representative like those involved in parent-teacher organizations, principals/administration, or teachers before these kits can be offered to parents. Parents can reach out to the PTA/PTO, teachers, or school administration to express interest in the EduKit program and encourage them to <a href="school-information.html">fill out this interest form</a>.</p>
                                <p class="description">Once EduKit is set up for a particular classroom or school, parents can <a href="find-your-school.html">order supply kits for their students</a>.</p>

                                <p class="description">For parents, school supply kits can provide a long list of benefits. Getting a school supply kit online can help parents save time and money, avoid frustration, and focus on the things that really matter.</p>
                                <p class="description bold blue">Save time from back-to-school-shopping</p>
                                <p class="description">Parents can save time by purchasing a kit that includes all the supplies needed instead of spending hours searching in stores and online. Parents will not need to hunt down one or two stray items on a school supply list at a different online retailer because EduKit does ALL of the shopping.

                                <p class="description">Every student deserves the same access to education. Inside the classroom, learning can be hindered by something as small as having the wrong supplies or no supplies at all. When students do not have the correct supplies, it is more difficult for teachers to follow through with planned activities and lessons. This can slow down the teaching process and, ultimately, the learning process as well.</p>
                                <p class="description bold teal">School administration - Benefits of online school supply kits</p>
                                <p class="description">School administrators often spend a significant amount of time and energy focusing on ways to ensure equity of access for each student. The supply kit program from EduKit can assist with that goal by helping administrators ensure that each student has the exact supplies and tools they need for success. In addition, making sure that all students have the supplies they need is <a href="blog/07/02/2020/how-school-supply-kits-help-foster-success-in-your-school.html">a way for administrators to support their staff in the classroom</a>.</p>

Working with EduKit is a win-win for parents and teachers which makes it a perfect project for parent organizations to take on. Leadership in parent organizations can help get the EduKit program set up at their school. If you are a school representative through a parent organization, you can start the process of getting EduKit at your school by <a href="School-Information-2.html">filling out the school information form</a>.</p>

Distance learners still need the correct supplies in order to succeed. In fact, it may be more crucial for distance learners to have the correct supplies because the teacher is not nearby to provide replacements or alternatives. The <a href="schools/1339/EduKit%20Home%20Kits%20Colorado%20Springs%2c%20CO.html">home supply kits</a> are filled with age-appropriate supplies so at-home learners have the supplies they need.</p>

                                <p class="description">EduKit is all about solutions. We understand that there is still significant uncertainty around how schools will be approaching their semesters - either at home or in person. A hybrid approach, where students would need to continue learning from both the classroom, and at home, will most likely continue to take place in the fall. Because there may now be a need for students to have access to supplies in both locations, EduKit is proud to offer a new program to supply students with both the customized supplies they will need available in the classroom as well as those needed at home. EduKit has a variety of different ways we can meet the needs for schools with a hybrid learning arrangement.  We will work with each school individually to set up a program just right for them.</p>

                                <p class="description">EduKits can either be delivered directly to the school or right to the student’s home so each student has all of the necessary supplies from day one – this ensures equity of access and minimizes stress. There is always some apprehension as the first day of a new school year approaches, but easy supply delivery can help reduce some of the stress students and parents feel at the beginning of school. Dealing with a pile of supplies and making sure to get all of them to school can add extra stress for students and parents on the first day. EduKit eliminates the need for students to separate supplies and lug them to class at the beginning of the school year.</p>

It typically involved an exhausting day going from store to store and combing through unorganized jumbles of school supplies until finally (hopefully) marking the last item off the list. The advent of online shopping relieved some of the stress by making it possible for parents to purchase school supplies online. Unfortunately, the process can still be time-consuming and frustrating because each grade has a specific list of school supplies. Purchasing school supplies online makes it easy to search for what you need but it may still require you to make purchases from multiple retailers.</p>
