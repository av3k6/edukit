&lt;p&gt;To give you an honest, behind-the-scenes look at what&amp;rsquo;s involved, Dana, a PTO member and EduKit Coordinator for her school, shares her experience in this video. Spoiler alert: it&amp;rsquo;s simpler than you might think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Dana&amp;rsquo;s Testimonial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to hear Dana&amp;rsquo;s full story and see how straightforward the process is? Watch the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/64g19OEB_Qg?si=og5c49n4eB2co0dt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Simple and Time-Efficient Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video, Dana highlights just how easy it is to coordinate an EduKit program. She estimates it takes her &lt;strong&gt;about two hours total for the entire year&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s because EduKit takes care of the heavy lifting&amp;mdash;everything from assembling the kits to delivering them directly to the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana also emphasizes that the process doesn&amp;rsquo;t burden the school staff or teachers. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have to bother the school,&amp;rdquo; she explains. &amp;ldquo;Teachers aren&amp;rsquo;t worrying about it. It&amp;rsquo;s just me communicating with EduKit and then with school staff as needed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Parents and Teachers Love EduKit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Dana&amp;rsquo;s favorite parts? The kits are ready and waiting in the classroom on &lt;strong&gt;Meet the Teacher Day&lt;/strong&gt;, eliminating the chaos of parents juggling armfuls of school supplies. &amp;ldquo;Instead of a long line of kids and parents trying to carry supplies, the EduKits are already in the classroom. That makes it so much easier for everyone,&amp;rdquo; Dana shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to Simplify Back-to-School?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinating a school supply kit program doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be overwhelming. With EduKit, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a reliable partner that handles the details, leaving you with more time to focus on what really matters&amp;mdash;your school community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently sat down with PTO Today to chat about school supply kits and how EduKit works with schools and parent groups to save time and simplify back-to-school prep for families and schools. Watch the full interview &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1TsfXF2g5b/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the inside scoop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="314" style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=314&amp;amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FPTOToday%2Fvideos%2F1103056314514745%2F&amp;amp;show_text=false&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;t=0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is EduKit?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKit transforms school supply lists into convenient, customized kits delivered right to schools or homes. It's all about reducing back-to-school stress by ensuring students get exactly what they need&amp;mdash;no more, no less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Does EduKit Work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKit partners with schools and parent groups to create kits based on teachers&amp;rsquo; supply lists. Each kit is customized for every grade, ensuring it&amp;rsquo;s tailored to what students need for their classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the Role of Parent Group Leaders?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parent group leaders act as &amp;ldquo;School Coordinators,&amp;rdquo; working with EduKit to set up the program for their school. Coordinators only need a small time commitment&amp;mdash;many report spending as little as two hours each year to manage their program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Program, Step-by-Step&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKit kicks off planning in late winter by reaching out to coordinators, gathering teacher lists and setting up a custom ordering webpage. Schools can also turn EduKit into a small fundraiser, adding a few dollars to each kit price to benefit their school or support families in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quality Supplies, Less Waste&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our kits include only the items teachers request, and the brands they love&amp;mdash;eliminating unnecessary waste and saving families money. During the interview, Rachel got to unbox a sample kit, showcasing our high-quality supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ready to Learn More?&lt;/h3&gt;

Do you want to &lt;strong&gt;ensure all students have access to essential supplies&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reduce the stress of the back-to-school process&lt;/strong&gt;? Implementing a school supply kit program can help achieve these goals. This blog post will provide you with six practical tips to successfully launch and manage a kit program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="4:1-4:169"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="467" alt="" src="/Media/Default/Images/Student%20with%20School%20Supplies.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="4:1-4:169"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Start Early and Engage with Kit Providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="7:1-7:119"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="7:1-7:119"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Begin planning your school supply kit program early - even in the fall or winter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; This gives you ample time to research and select a reputable kit provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="8:1-9:0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Utilize last year's supply list as a starting point and work closely with your kit provider to understand costs,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; benefits,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and customization options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="10:1-10:44"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step&amp;nbsp;2: Educate Your School Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="11:1-13:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="11:1-11:135"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inform school administrators,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; teachers,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and families about the advantages of a kit program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; They can become your strongest advocates!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="12:1-13:0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your school community is unfamiliar with kit programs,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; collaborate with your kit provider to provide educational resources and materials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="14:1-14:41"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Secure School Supply Lists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="15:1-15:133"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="15:1-15:133"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Partner with teachers to gather accurate supply lists for each grade level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; This process is typically completed in late February or April.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="16:1-17:0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure that all necessary lists are collected to create comprehensive and tailored kits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/program"&gt;EduKit&lt;/a&gt; offers helpful tools and resources to facilitate this process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="18:1-18:34"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step&amp;nbsp;4: Finalize Kit Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="19:1-22:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="19:1-19:90"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Work closely with your kit provider to&amp;nbsp;find the supplies that will work best&amp;nbsp;for your school. At EduKit, we make the quoting process quick &amp;amp; painless!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="20:1-20:83"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consider factors such as quality,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; quantity,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and price when finalizing kit quotes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="21:1-22:0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure that the kits meet your school's specific needs and preferences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="23:1-23:45"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5: Market the Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="24:1-25:102"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="24:1-24:84"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leverage the marketing tools provided by your kit provider to promote the program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="25:1-25:102"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Utilize newsletters,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; emails,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; printed materials,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and social media to reach families and the community. At &lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/program"&gt;EduKit&lt;/a&gt;, we have all of these resources, and more!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="26:1-27:0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Use&amp;nbsp;engaging content that highlights the benefits of the kit program,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; such as convenience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="28:1-28:42"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step&amp;nbsp;6: Distribute Kits Efficiently&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="29:1-31:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="29:1-29:124"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Determine the most suitable distribution method for your school,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; whether it's shipping to homes or distributing at school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="30:1-31:0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consider factors such as the availability of volunteers,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the timing of back-to-school events,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and the organization of your school to make the best decision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="32:1-32:172"&gt;By following these six steps, you can successfully implement a school supply kit program that benefits your school community and streamlines the back-to-school process.&amp;nbsp;Ready to start planning?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In today's fast-paced world, the boundaries between home and school often blur. As parents, we understand the intrinsic value of teachers in our children&amp;rsquo;s lives. They do more than just impart knowledge; they nurture, guide, and stand as pillars of support. They often care for our children as they would their own, showing dedication and commitment that goes beyond the classroom. With classrooms bustling with anywhere from 15 to 30 eager learners, it's clear that teachers carry a significant responsibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet, have we ever stopped to consider how we, as parents, can collaborate with these educators to ensure our children are thriving in the best possible environment?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Building Bridges through the Parent-Teacher Relationship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The foundation of a thriving educational experience is a solid parent-teacher bond. This alliance isn't limited to yearly conferences but thrives on consistent, year-round communication. As parents, facilitating platforms for mutual discussions and building a community atmosphere can make a world of difference in our children's academic journey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open Communication: A Mutual Exchange: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consistent communication between parents and teachers ensures both sides understand a child's academic and personal needs. It's a two-way street: teachers offer insights into school life, while parents shed light on home dynamics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:1095,&amp;quot;335559738&amp;quot;:280,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Engagement Beyond Classroom Walls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Teachers can share class events and activities, inviting parents to participate. Such involvement might range from volunteering at school events to contributing resources for class projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:1095,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Platform for Parent Voices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Parents need spaces where they can voice their concerns or suggestions. Schools can support this by organizing forums or workshops, allowing parents to engage with teachers and fellow parents, and fostering community understanding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:1095,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating a Community of Stakeholders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;: When parents and teachers work in harmony, they build a robust academic community. An involved parent becomes an advocate for the school, and a supported teacher feels more fulfilled, benefiting everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:1095,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:280,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559685&amp;quot;:1095,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:280,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW157086130 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun Highlight SCXW195893678 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW195893678 BCX0"&gt;Learning Beyond the Bell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW195893678 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="600" height="400" title="Parent-Teacher Relationship - &amp;ldquo;Parents as Teachers&amp;rdquo; Approach" alt="smiling young boy doing homework and giving a high-five to his mom" src="/Media/Default/Images/Parent-Teacher%20Relationship%20-%20&amp;ldquo;Parents%20as%20Teachers&amp;rdquo;%20Appoach.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the school bell rings, signaling the close of another academic day, it doesn't mean the curtain falls on learning. Rather, it's the beginning of a different act in the educational theater: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; study. Homework isn't merely a chore to fill the evening hours; it's a purposeful continuation of classroom teachings, meticulously designed to keep young minds ticking and exploring even outside the school environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Understanding our child's academic rhythm allows us to synchronize our involvement with their learning journey. This doesn't mean we need to hover or micromanage. Instead, by carving out just a few minutes daily to discuss what they've been working on or to go over a particularly challenging assignment, we can make an invaluable impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;all gestures demonstrate our genuine interest in their academic endeavors, subtly reinforcing the importance of education. It also provides them with a safe space to voice any concerns, ask questions, or simply share something exciting they've learned. This parental involvement doesn't go unnoticed. Studies, as well as countless personal anecdotes, affirm that children who sense this interest and involvement from their family at home not only develop a richer curiosity for their subjects but also tend to excel in their academic pursuits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Empowerment through the Parent Teacher Association and Parent Teacher Organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diving into the world of the PTA or PTO is more than just penciling in meetings on a calendar or rallying for the next fundraising event. It's about immersing oneself in a dynamic community, unified by the shared mission of enriching our children's education. These organizations provide parents a platform to voice their opinions, collaborate with educators, and work towards creating optimal learning environments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But how can PTA or PTO members tangibly contribute to this noble mission? One standout solution is to integrate an innovative program like EduKit into the school's system. At its core, EduKit offers a practical, yet transformative, solution by supplying school kits tailored to the needs of students. These kits come loaded with essential tools required for the academic year, eliminating the perennial stress and hassle of back-to-school shopping many parents might dread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For parents, it's a much-needed respite from hunting down supplies in crowded stores, comparing prices, and making sure nothing is overlooked. Instead, they can rest assured knowing that their children will have everything they need, right from the get-go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For teachers, this initiative is a boon. They can commence the year on a positive note, devoid of concerns about students not having the essential supplies. It fosters an atmosphere where educators can focus on what they do best: teaching, without being bogged down by logistical challenges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating a Dialog: Parent Teacher Conference Questions to Ask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the summer break winds down, the back-to-school season approaches, bringing excitement and challenges for teachers and parents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After a relaxing summer, it can be overwhelming to transition back into the school routine again. From school lunch ideas to after-school activities, there is a lot to prepare for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this blog, we help simplify the back-to-school process and explore how EduKit can help make the transition a breeze for parents, teachers, and students alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preparing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt; for the new school year goes beyond just checking off items on a school supply checklist. Your readiness for the new school year sets the foundation for your student's academic success and well-being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because when students have the necessary tools available, they can focus on learning and achieving their full potential without the stress of being thrown back into a school routine with only partial back-to-school lists completed. Additionally, a good action plan significantly reduces stress for parents and teachers, allowing them to create an environment that promotes growth and development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To ensure your student's success, it is crucial to have a well-thought-out plan before the new school year catches you off guard.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The beginning of the school season is the perfect time to establish open lines of communication between parents and teachers. Establishing and maintaining open lines of communication allows parents to stay informed about their child's academic journey and enables teachers to address any concerns or provide the necessary support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Update all your contact information with the school and get any phone numbers or emails for the teachers your child will learn from. Ask at the beginning of the school year for parent-teacher meeting dates and mark your calendar or set a reminder so you don&amp;rsquo;t forget. Teachers are here to help! Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to reach out if you have questions about your child&amp;rsquo;s engagement in the classroom or ask how you can reinforce the learning curriculum at home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Help your children make the most of their summer break by encouraging them to pursue a new hobby. Whether they whip up tasty dishes, dive into captivating books, or explore photography, these hobbies can keep them engaged, promote their development, and create lasting summer memories that may carry on throughout their lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what about the upcoming school year? As a parent, you know that back-to-school time often means the hassle of shopping for school supplies. The good news is, there's a solution that can save you time and make the process a breeze: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/blog/06/04/2020/5-benefits-of-school-supply-kits-from-edukit"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink"&gt;EduKit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Inform your school about EduKit and encourage them to set up a program. If your school has already partnered with EduKit, don't hesitate to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/find-your-school"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink"&gt;order a kit for your child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:240}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Are Customized School Kits Important for Education?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW134442200 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW134442200 BCX0"&gt;With a personalized school kit, teachers can plan and organize their lessons and classrooms efficiently. When students bring all their supplies into the classroom, it&amp;rsquo;s easier for the teacher and children to execute the preplanned lessons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW134442200 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW85012540 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW85012540 BCX0"&gt;Why Should You Purchase School Supplies from EduKit?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW85012540 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW90585555 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW90585555 BCX0"&gt;While school supplies are crucial for lessons, purchasing every item individually can be challenging for parents. Every parent knows the hustle before school even begins when the stores become packed with fresh supplies like pencils, markers, and binders. However, finding all the necessary school items in one place is challenging due to the customized supply requirements given by each teacher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW90585555 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW143764530 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW143764530 BCX0"&gt;You &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW143764530 BCX0"&gt;may have to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW143764530 BCX0"&gt;visit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW143764530 BCX0"&gt; multiple stores to collect all the items on your child&amp;rsquo;s list. So, eventually putting all the green checks in your kid's school supply list becomes frustrating, exhausting, and time-consuming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW143764530 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online shopping is a great alternative. Shopping for supplies online makes it much easier as parents don't have to drive to multiple shops. However, you still might not find all the items in one place and must collect school supplies from multiple vendors and wait for multiple shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW166650323 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166650323 BCX0"&gt;Online shopping is a great alternative.

But insufficient/incorrect items can create problems for teachers, hampering their planned classroom activities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW96499498 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to EduKit&amp;rsquo;s premium school supplies, teachers and parents can benefit from getting a custom school supply kit. With EduKit, teachers can easily personalize a supply list for their students, and parents can order all the items they need from one place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW266796145 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is important to pay attention to the ordering deadline advertised by your school.&amp;nbsp; Make sure to order your child&amp;rsquo;s supplies so they arrive in time for school; orders will not be accepted after the deadline set by the school! It&amp;rsquo;s as easy as 1,2,3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW1551998 BCX0"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW1551998 BCX0"&gt;1.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once your school has set up the EduKit program, ordering through the EduKit website is easy.&amp;nbsp; Simply go to the EduKit website at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.edukitinc.com"&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="none"&gt;&lt;span&gt;www.edukitinc.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span&gt; and find your school to place your order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you have found your school, provide your student&amp;rsquo;s basic information so that the kit will be delivered to the right student.&amp;nbsp; Make sure to select the grade your student will be going into next year so that you receive the correct supply kit!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After submitting student information and clicking Next, you will be directed to a comprehensive selection of grade-specific kits available for purchase.

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.edukitinc.com/Media/Default/Images/School%20Supply%20Donation%20Programs.jpg" alt="A box marked for donations filled with various school supplies like scissors, notebooks, pens, paints, and a backpack" title="School supply donation programs" width="700" height="467" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers and parents know how important it can be to have quality school supplies in the classroom. For teachers, quality classroom supplies are crucial for them to be able to adequately teach their students. Ideally, no teacher should ever have an issue with having enough supplies. For parents, they want their children to succeed in school and learn all they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know all too well, this can happen to any school. Just having enough materials can be a struggle for some classrooms, and unfortunately, teachers are often left to either pay for supplies out of their own pocket or go without simple items such as pencils, paper, notebooks. It&amp;rsquo;s an unfortunate reality that all teachers should prepare for so they can ensure they&amp;rsquo;re never without the essential supplies they and their students need and can start the year confidently. In today&amp;rsquo;s blog, we have gathered a few of the best ways to collect school items for your next school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1 &amp;ndash; Get Your School Started with EduKit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKit is a revolutionary program that makes it easy for students to get the supplies they need with ease. EduKit works by giving customizable options to schools and classrooms by letting teachers choose what each kit will include. Once the kit contents are decided by your teachers, parents order all their child's school supplies online with the click of a button. From there, supplies are delivered directly to your school, making it easy for students to get the supplies they need without any hassle. Because teachers make the customized supplies list, they can ensure nothing is missed, choose brands that make the pricing easier to manage for parents, and provide every student with the same access to quality supplies that set them up for a successful school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKit programs are easy to implement and sustain at your school. There are even fundraising options available for the school, so that raised funds can go towards education systems or even ordering teacher supplies for every classroom. Use EduKit for a school supply program you can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2 &amp;ndash; Donate Money for Supplies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things easy, the PTA at your school could organize a way in which parents could donate money for students who need quality supplies. If the end of the year is creeping up and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of time for the administration to approve a school supplies fundraiser, this could be a viable option for next year. The school can then pool the donated money for supplies and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/school-information"&gt;talk to EduKit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about ordering kits in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, anything and any amount will help. By implementing this kind of plan, you can also get a good feel for how willing others are to participate in something such as this and how involved they want to be when it comes to fundraising efforts. Sometimes, the end of the year can be crazy with all the classroom parties and preparing students for summer, so a simple donation effort &amp;ndash; like sending a donation envelope home with students &amp;ndash; can help alleviate the extra planning that would need to happen at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3 &amp;ndash; Host an End-of-Year School Supplies Drive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the year, when school is out for summer, a lot of the leftover supplies from the year are thrown out or never used again. Some people may be wondering how to donate these supplies to schools. An end of the year school supplies drive is a great way to give these supplies a second life. Any lightly used items can be used again by collecting these and distributing them to classrooms for the next school year. Pencils, pens, folders, notebooks, binders, erasers, notecards, and other common school supplies are items that can be used again and again. Simply set up bins around each hallway or the front entrance, and as students or teachers begin clearing out their desks and classrooms, they can drop off their donation supplies. This can help these items avoid the landfill and give teachers extra supplies to distribute as needed in the upcoming school year. This is a great way to show young students the importance of donating school supplies, recycling, and helping eliminate waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign Up for an EduKit Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKit has been transforming the way students get school supplies for over 30 years, and we would love to make gathering your school supplies lists simple. Students love high-quality, name-brand supplies just as much as teachers love having students that have all the supplies they need to stay focused in lessons and succeed throughout the school year. EduKit provides the chance for parents to save time and money by eliminating trips to the store and gives teachers peace of mind that their students have everything they need. Each kit is tailor-made for every unique classroom, and supplies can be provided for any grade level. We want every back-to-school experience to be non-stressful and easy for teachers, parents, and students alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bulk Up Your School Supply Stash: Top 10 Must-Have Items&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a new teacher or have been teaching for years, having the right school supplies continually on hand is essential for creating an engaging and organized classroom setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From paper supplies to coloring materials, pencils to scissors, and everything in between, having a full stock of bulk classroom supplies for teachers is crucial to ensure that your students have everything they need to succeed. If you already know which supplies you need, &lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/school-information"&gt;contact EduKit&lt;/a&gt; for a quote to supply your classroom for the 23/24 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've compiled a list of the top 10 best school supplies for teachers to help keep their classrooms full at all times. By ordering in bulk, you can ensure that your students always have the supplies they need, and save money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Paper Supplies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to classroom supplies, there's one item that reigns supreme: paper. Seriously, it's a must-have for any classroom, no matter the grade or subject. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s being used for taking notes, homework, or getting creative with arts and crafts, it&amp;rsquo;s inevitable that your students will forget notebooks or run out of space on what they have. Think about stocking up on different types of paper, such as construction paper, printer paper, and notebook paper to cover all your bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;Coloring Supplies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coloring is a fun and engaging activity for all students but especially elementary students. If you want your class to stay engaged and unleash their creativity, make sure you have plenty of coloring supplies on hand! As a teacher, you know how fast your students can run through a box of crayons&amp;mdash; you can never have too many! From crayons to markers to colored pencils, having a variety of options will keep them excited and focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Glue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you often do crafts or science experiments in your classroom, one thing's for sure: glue is a must-have for school. It's super versatile and necessary for getting those projects done right. Make sure you've got an excess stock of different glue types, like glue sticks and liquid glue, to give your students the adhesive they need to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;b&gt;Pencils&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pencils are another classic choice for school supplies. They're versatile and used for everything from jotting down notes, taking important exams, or doodling for students who focus better when multi-tasking. They are easy to use but easy to lose too! Consider stocking up on sharpened pencils in bulk so you always have plenty on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;b&gt;Scissors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scissors are like the Swiss Army Knife of the classroom. From cutting out paper shapes to learn fractions, creating art projects, or cutting up materials for practical science application, you have to have a good pair of scissors by your side. Which means having several on hand for a full classroom is a must. Consider stocking up on different sizes and styles of scissors to accommodate different age groups and skill levels. Another great thing about scissors? Keep a dedicated borrow bin for the scissors and you can continue to use the same ones from year to year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;b&gt;Index Cards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index cards are a handy school supply that can be used for everything from flashcards to note-taking. Stock up on different sizes and colors of index cards to give your students plenty of options for organizing and studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;b&gt;Rubber Bands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubber bands are a lesser thought of but are useful school supplies that can be used for everything from organizing papers to creating simple machines. And it&amp;rsquo;s one of those supplies many teachers tend to forget until it&amp;rsquo;s needed. Consider stocking up on a range of sizes and colors to give you and your students plenty of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. &lt;b&gt;Paper Clips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper clips are another small adaptable school supply that can be used for everything from organizing papers to creating crafts. Like with rubber bands, consider stocking up on different sizes and colors for lots of options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. &lt;b&gt;Tissues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissues are a must-have school supply, especially during cold and flu season&amp;mdash; there never seems to be enough! Having a full stock of tissues always on hand can save a sleeve and the inevitable spread of germs. Or can be used to clean up any spills from snack time or science projects. By bulking up on boxes of tissues, you help keep your classroom clean and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;b&gt;Pens&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pens are an essential school supply for slightly older students. From note-taking to test-taking, having plenty of pens on hand is super important. And just like pencils, pens seem to constantly get misplaced. Stock up on a mixture of colors and styles to accommodate different writing styles and preferences among your students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ordering in Bulk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to create a classroom environment that is both successful and engaging, having plenty of classroom supplies is absolutely essential. Stocking up on supplies in bulk ensures that your students have everything they need to thrive throughout the school year. And when it comes to ordering in large quantities, &lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/school-supplies" title="Order Bulk School Supplies" alt="Order Bulk School Supplies"&gt;EduKit&amp;rsquo;s bulk school supply service&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools work hard to provide a well-rounded education for a promising future, but don&amp;rsquo;t always have funds for some of the extra things that make the school experience that much more enjoyable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field trips, educational supplies, special projects, sports, classroom improvements, and many other school upgrades require lots of investment &amp;ndash; often upwards of several thousand dollars. Unfortunately, outside funding and school boards usually only manage a portion of the cost needed for many of these activities and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding fundraisers is a great way for schools to fund activities and create positive experiences for students and families. &amp;nbsp;One of the most important factors when choosing a fundraiser is simplicity.&amp;nbsp; Keeping things simple helps increase participation and overall success rates. &amp;nbsp;Here are 8 simple fundraising ideas that are perfect for elementary schools and sure to be a hit with teachers and parents alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edukit Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/"&gt;Edukit Fundraising&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best ways to provide your students with the supplies they need while fundraising at the same time.

There are no minimum purchase requirements to set up an EduKit program, they are shipped to either the student&amp;rsquo;s home or to the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up an EduKit program as a fundraiser is easy.&amp;nbsp; Dedicated account managers have experience setting up fundraiser programs in a variety of ways and will work with you to develop the best program for your school. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s a win, win for everyone- parents order all their school supplies in less time than it takes to get the kids in the car.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Students are well prepared with the supplies they need and the school earns money on each kit purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

With just a few clicks, they can place their order online. &lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/"&gt;Sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt; up&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;for our fundraising program and get premium school supplies with the opportunity to raise funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book Collection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A book collection fundraiser is a fun way to encourage children to raise donations. Here the idea is to give books as presents to the students to raise funds. Partner up with a local library, as they also benefit from students taking more interest in reading and literacy. Plus, any books that aren&amp;rsquo;t given to the children can be donated to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few &lt;a href="https://lovemylibrary.com/"&gt;library fundraiser platforms&lt;/a&gt; that allow donation collection for schools. You can sign up for such programs and ask students to create their own donation pages. They can then easily reach out to family and friends online to raise funds and earn their favorite books as rewards. This type of fundraiser can also be held completely online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50/50 Raffle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raffle draws are some of the most creative and simplest ways to raise funds for schools. Festivals, fairs, trivia nights, game events, and many other events offer an excellent venue for holding a raffle.&amp;nbsp; Often with little or no booth fee for schools. &amp;nbsp;A 50/50 raffle is similar to a regular raffle with a small variation. In a 50/50 raffle, the school keeps half of the amount collected from ticket sales, while the winner receives the other half. Make sure to promote the event to attract lots of participants. Keeping the ticket price low is another good way to increase sales.&amp;nbsp; Raffles offer a high rate of return for minimal effort in organizing, and can be done repeatedly throughout the year. &amp;nbsp;Think sporting events at your high school, and announce the winners at half time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bake Sale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arranging a fair of baked goods is delightful for everyone. Encourage all the parents, students, and staff to prepare baked goods and sell them at stalls. You can also invite restaurants to sell baked food items at your fair. Here you can charge stall fees to raise funds or negotiate a percentage of the sales from each stall to generate donations.&amp;nbsp; Local grocery stores will often donate to these types of fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;5. &lt;strong&gt;Picture Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider having a picture day event at your school. &amp;nbsp;Partner with a local photographer, or one who takes your school pictures in the Fall. Set up the event in the cafeteria or gymnasium, advertising fun family portraits that support the school&amp;rsquo;s goals to raise money.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This unique idea is successful because parents love having the portrait, but organizing the time to make it happen can be a struggle.&amp;nbsp; Promote your event with letters sent home with students.&amp;nbsp; Encourage family portraits, sibling portraits, friend group portraits &amp;ndash; the sky is the limit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select a day for the picture event and invite the whole community. We suggest preparing a few simple package options for parents to select for purchase.&amp;nbsp; Print copies or post the package options on a QR code that parents can easily scan and order prints. &amp;nbsp;Preparing beforehand helps prevent confusion and hassle on the big day. Don't forget, customarily, the photographer receives a portion of the donations.&amp;nbsp; Negotiating the best terms for your school up front can ensure optimum benefits for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holiday Decor Sales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting a holiday decor fair at the school is an innovative and fun event for schools that can be focused on a variety of holidays.&amp;nbsp; Place a donation box by the admin office to collect used decor and crafts from students as the holiday draws near. Then sell the d&amp;eacute;cor at an event fair hosted by the school.&amp;nbsp; Local businesses will often donate supplies for these types of fundraisers. Invite students, families, and community members to your fair to boost sales. Collaborate with parents and staff to create one-of-a-kind decorations for your school fair to raise more funds. You can also encourage students to make handmade creations for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art Show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrange an art exhibition in your school hall or grounds where students can showcase their paintings and artwork created at school. Invite parents, relatives and the community to the exhibition. You can raise funds through ticket sales, donations, and through the sale of the artwork itself.&amp;nbsp; A fun approach to this fundraising option is for schools to have multiple grades participate in a common theme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="8"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restaurant Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fundraiser will help you earn donations while supporting local businesses. Collaborate with&amp;nbsp; local restaurants and food trucks interested in promoting their businesses at your school.&amp;nbsp; Hold a dining out event where people can sample select items from each vendor. &amp;nbsp;Spread the word about the event to your student&amp;rsquo;s families and the community. The vendors donate a portion of sales to the fundraising campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter which fundraising campaign your school selects, keep in mind the overall goal: benefitting everyone involved. Involve your local PTA. Ask students what they thought about the last fundraising event held.&amp;nbsp; What did they like best, and what did they like least? &amp;nbsp;Factor these details into your decision.&amp;nbsp; It will help with the participation rates later. Lastly, always make sure to manage your expectations of Teacher&amp;rsquo;s involvement. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy fundraising!&amp;nbsp; With the funds raised, you can continue to provide students with the &amp;ldquo;extras&amp;rdquo; that make the school year more memorable. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please post images and updates of your fundraisers throughout the year on social media, and tag Edukit so that we can help cheer you on!&amp;nbsp; We love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/5-best-fundraising-ideas-for-elementary-schools/</guid></item><item><title>Make Back-To-School Simple by Managing your Spending, Routine, and More</title><link>https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/managing-your-spending-routine-and-more/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="466" title="Back to School Shopping Tips for Parents" alt="Back to School Shopping Tips for Parents" src="/Media/Default/Images/Back%20to%20School%20Shopping%20Tips%20for%20Parents%20(1).jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Back-To-School Simple by Managing your Spending, Routine, and More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back-to-school season always starts earlier than we expect it to. Of course, there's the big fall kick off that arrives after the lazy days of summer, where we&amp;rsquo;re putting the final touches on our car-pooling plans and marking our calendars for the first parent nights. But far before then, we start rallying our kids back into school mode, after they've had months of sleeping late and playing outside all day. Oftentimes, that final back-to-school push is the one we most dread because we&amp;rsquo;re rushing to get everything in place in time for the first day of school. But what if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be so stressful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back-to-school tips for parents&amp;nbsp;can really apply to any time of the year, but experience tells us that when preparing for a new school year, you should always plan in advance on as many levels as you can to minimize stress. As summer approaches and we begin to dread the idea of preparing for another school year, the first thing we should begin to wrangle into reality is the new schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for School Spending and Look for Special Deals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all feel the financial impact of kids returning to school&amp;mdash;especially once schools start requiring more and more books or specific materials for projects later in the year. In fact, for some families, back-to-school is the costliest time of the year.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;For tips to manage back to school spending, we suggest a couple of money-saving tricks. For clothes, shop on tax-free weekends, and for larger items like laptops, tablets, or headphones, look for deals online and price-matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for school supplies? Find a place where you can buy all your kid&amp;rsquo;s school supplies in one place, as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/program"&gt;school supply bundles&lt;/a&gt; tend to save more money than buying various materials from different places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let Edukit Handle Your Kids' School Supplies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to school supplies, breathe a sigh of relief because Edukit&amp;nbsp;does all your shopping for you with the convenience of a couple of clicks and at the price of a school supply bundle. Your school sends us their &lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/district-kits"&gt;teacher's customized supply list&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to order all their children's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/online-school-supplies"&gt;school supplies online&lt;/a&gt; in less time than it takes to get the kids in the car. Edukit also delivers the kits so the kids are ready to go on day one.&amp;nbsp; We encourage any interested parent or teacher to contact us now, in preparation for next school year to obtain a quote for your school.&amp;nbsp; Preparedness from all angles is key for a successful back to school season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Realistic Plan to Transition Kids into a School Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going from midnight star-gazing to lights out at nine doesn't happen overnight, so we have to create a realistic plan that takes kids from relaxed summer hours to a tightened school-ready schedule. Try slipping in earlier bedtimes beginning a few weeks before school starts so that by the time the big day arrives, your kids will be accustomed to the new schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps harder than getting your kids in bed at night is getting them out of bed in the morning. We like to plan activities, surprises, or rewards that are so delightful, even the groggiest child can't resist them. Have breakfast out and then a final day at the water park? A trip to the bookstore or movies? Their favorite cartoon airs in the morning? Utilize whatever motivates your kids to help them have a smoother transition when the school bell chimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan Ahead for Healthy School Year Eating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer and holiday eating schedules are often whenever and whatever for many families, but school and nutrition go hand-in-hand in order to keep brain cells firing. The two weeks prior to school starting is the perfect time to get lunches sorted. Will Mom or Dad help pack lunches, or can you trust the kids to do it? For kids buying school lunch, find out how to log on to put money in their accounts ahead of time and cross that task off your list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also like to do some meal planning and even create freezer meals before school starts, keeping in mind that time will be in shorter supply come September. Sheet pan meals, which allow you to cook vegetables and protein together with little cleanup, can be a big help, as can slow cooker or pressure cooker meals. Maybe create a list of fallback meals that can be frozen afterwards, or if you are particularly organized, choose a large meal for each week in the month to order the ingredients ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Sure Everyone Has Space to Learn and Work at Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole reason we send our kids to school is for them to learn, and we want that learning to continue at home when they have homework or projects to complete. Just like us, they need a well-equipped space where they can consistently go to concentrate and complete their tasks. Set up a place that avoids TV and distractions and has space for each child. If necessary, use cardboard dividers that your kids can decorate for a more private space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parents Need Back-To-School Organization as Well&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some back-to-school organization is for the benefit of parents. For example, we love the idea of a parent&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.organizedmom.net/getting-ready-for-school/"&gt;inbox&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;into which kids put permission slips that need to be signed, notes from teachers, lunch menus, PTA reminders, homework they want you to look at - anything that needs a parent's eyes and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be forgotten about. The key to making this work is diligence on the part of both kids and parents and making sure the box stays in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another brilliant idea is for parents who drive their kids to school: an on-the-go car kit. Did someone forget breakfast? Grab a granola or cereal bar from the car kit. Need a last-minute signature? There's a pen in the car kit. Safety pin? Lunch money? The answers to today&amp;rsquo;s test? All in the car kit - except maybe that last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family organization is nothing without a calendar listing everyone's activities, but the days of giant paper calendars and sharpies may be becoming a thing of the past. With sports, activities, and everyday life, we couldn't survive without a&lt;a href="https://www.organizedmom.net/sharing-digital-calendars-with-the-family-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;family digital calendar&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;so that every family member knows where to be when, what time, and with what gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Routines to Ensure Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest elements of going back-to-school involves ensuring that everyone is safe as they follow the new routines. If your kids are taking the bus, teach your children bus safety rules and practice with them. Kids who will be walking or riding bikes to school need several practice runs with Mom or Dad before soloing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the kids ready for back to school may not be one of life's great pleasures, but with Edukit and some careful planning, the transition doesn't have to be traumatic. Plan for back-to-school early and take the stress out of the start of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/managing-your-spending-routine-and-more/</guid></item><item><title>New Years Resolution: Getting Your Family Involved in the Community</title><link>https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/getting-family-involved-in-the-community/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Years Resolution: Getting Your Family Involved in the Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for a meaningful and rewarding New Year's resolution for you and your family? Consider getting your family involved in the community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will getting involved in your community help you to feel more connected and grounded, but it can also be a wonderful way to teach your children about giving back and making a positive impact on the world around them. We speak from experience, as EduKit gives back with donations and support for multiple non-profit foundations in our community throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Clean Up&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roll up your sleeves and put your gloves on for this one because one way to get your family involved in the community is by participating in a community clean-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are picking up litter in a local park or helping to tidy up a community garden, this is a great way to give back to your community and make it a more beautiful and welcoming place to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also a great opportunity to spend some quality time together as a family, while teaching your children the importance of taking care of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping the Elderly&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping the elderly is not only a way to give back to the community, but it can also be a rewarding and meaningful experience for families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your family can offer a helping hand with tasks the elderly struggle with, like grocery shopping or yard work, eliminating the stress that elderly members of the community may be facing and having a significant impact on the quality of life for these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But simply spending some time visiting with older members of the community can do wonders and is a great way to help many who are lonely and isolated. Devoting time to the elderly can provide much-needed companionship, especially for families with young children as their own are grown, as older people often enjoy the energy and innocence that children bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the impact you want to make in the New Year is to give back and make a positive effect on the world; we have some great efforts for you to dedicate to with your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="445" title="Tree Planting Community Events for Families" alt="Tree Planting Community Events for Families" src="/Media/Default/Images/Tree%20Planting%20Community%20Events%20for%20Families.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting PTA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting your school&amp;rsquo;s PTA and local schools is another great way to get your family involved in the community. One way to do this is by helping your school administration with setting up an EduKit program, which provides convenient&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/program"&gt;school supplies programs&lt;/a&gt; to schools who need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKits are boxes of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/district-kits"&gt;school supplies based off of teacher lists&lt;/a&gt; that are provided to students at the beginning of the year so they have all the materials they need for the year in one place. Setting up an EduKit program can involve a donation program to situate every student in a school with a kit, and can even be customized to coordinate with local schools to identify students who could benefit from the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a practical way for parents to make a difference in their school community by supporting the education of children in their neighborhood. It can be a great way to give back to your community by ensuring that all children have the resources they need to succeed in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donating Resources&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you and your family are looking to get involved in the community but don't have a ton of time to commit, don't worry! There are still plenty of ways to make a difference. One easy option is to donate to local causes or organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s clothes, toys, or household goods, there are organizations in your community that could benefit from your donations. This is a great way to declutter your home and give back at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some donation ideas include donating:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Clothes &amp;amp; household goods to local thrift shops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Canned or non-perishable food to local food banks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Bed linens for local homeless shelters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Books to local libraries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; School Supplies to school PTA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Pet food, cleaning supplies, and bedding for local animal shelters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKit gives donations to various causes throughout the year, by helping to raise donations or providing free school supply kits to communities that need them. Every year we set up school adoption programs to help students in our partner schools receive a school supply kit, we&amp;rsquo;ve partnered with different organizations we&amp;rsquo;ve donated supplies to, and recently we donated to a school in need of a supply closet donation simply because they reached out and asked for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2 years running, we have partnered with national organizations to provide&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/online-school-supplies"&gt;school supply kits&lt;/a&gt; for children who don&amp;rsquo;t have easy access to educational materials in New York City. In past years, we&amp;rsquo;ve participated in Stuff the Bus to donate money for children in need. And this year EduKit gifted a free school supply kit to every child musician in the El Sistema Colorado orchestra, a school music program which provides free string instruments and music education to youth in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust us when we say that giving back to the community will instill a sense of responsibility and joy while making the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="595" title="EduKit Donation to El Sistema Colorado" alt="EduKit Donation to El Sistema Colorado" src="/Media/Default/Images/EduKit%20Donation%20to%20El%20Sistema%20Colorado.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attending Local Events&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attending local family-friendly events is another great way to get your family involved in the community. These events are a great opportunity to have fun and meet new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events could include charity runs, community clean-up days, food drives, or cultural festivals. Not only do these events allow families to contribute to their community, but they also provide opportunities for families to come together and learn about different cultures and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participating in local events can also help to build a sense of pride and belonging within the community. So next time there's a local event happening in your area, consider getting your family involved and giving back to your community in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop Locally&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopping locally with your family is a great way to support small businesses in your community and help to stimulate the local economy. It's also a great opportunity to spend quality time together as a family and discover new and unique products and services offered by local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you shop at locally owned businesses, you are directly supporting families in your community. It can also be a fun and educational experience for your children, as they can learn about the unique products and services offered in your community while proving the importance of supporting their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting your family involved in community work is a great way to make a positive impact on the world around you, while also creating meaningful and rewarding experiences for your family. From helping the elderly to supporting local schools, there are endless opportunities for families to give back to their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple and impactful way to affect the community your family is a part of is by talking to your school administration about setting up an EduKit program to ensure every student at your school has the supplies they need for the year. By supporting the education of children in your community, you can help to create a brighter future for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter the new year, consider making one of your top resolutions to get your family involved in community work. Together, we can make a difference and build a stronger, more vibrant community.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/getting-family-involved-in-the-community/</guid></item><item><title>When Hot Chocolate Season Arrives, Try These Fun Recipes to Make with Your Kids </title><link>https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/hot-chocolate-recipes-to-make-with-your-kids/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Hot Chocolate Season Arrives, Try These Fun Recipes to Make with Your Kids &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the air turns nippy, kids' thoughts often turn to one of their favorite cold weather drinks: hot chocolate. And because getting kids into the kitchen creates healthy eating habits and is just plain fun, parents are constantly in search for recipes that are little-hands friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow Cookers Offer Safety and Yum Factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always stress safety first with our kids, so slow cookers or crock pots offer perfect alternatives to the traditional stove top method when choosing how to make hot chocolate with your kids. This process also gives kids the sense that they are really cooking up a delightful mixture, since the bowl to most slow cookers is nicely deep and wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot chocolate recipes for kids&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;can be just as delicious as those intended for adult palates, like this&amp;nbsp;yummy version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 cups low-fat milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 cups chocolate chips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine all ingredients in a slow cooker and whisk until they are combined, then heat until the mixture reaches the desired temperature. Top with whipped cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this hot chocolate recipe for kids, children as young as two can help by pouring or scooping in the chocolate chips then whisking away. Older children can measure and pour in the more delicate ingredients and even help determine when the mixture is ready to be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun on Top of Fun: Food Craft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many hot chocolate recipes for kids offer the perfect opportunity for kids to make a cozy drink for the whole family. Here are some ideas for how to spend a chilly afternoon in the kitchen making hot chocolate for kids plus its accompaniments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yummy hot chocolate with&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://mountainmamacooks.com/a-recipe-for-homemade-hot-cocoa-chocolate-covered-marshmallows/"&gt;Chocolate Covered Marshmallows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;will elicit lots of fun and giggles during the production process. Make hot chocolate in a crock pot using the above recipe. While the hot chocolate is warming, assemble the marshmallows by taking 8 jumbo marshmallows and dipping them in 1 cup of melted semisweet chocolate chips and then in crushed candy canes. Push a straw through each marshmallow before the chocolate hardens. Young children can help with every step of this recipe except for dipping the hot chocolate into cups, but they can do the fun part -- adding the marshmallow to the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food Gifts that Kids Can Help Make&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids love creating these&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://twoshadesofpink.blogspot.com/2011/12/mini-mason-jar-hot-chocolate.html"&gt;Mini Mason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hot Chocolate Jars complete with chocolate stirring spoons to give as gifts during the holiday season. Little hands are perfect for helping to layer in drink mix, marshmallows, chocolate chips, and peppermints in this hot chocolate recipe for kids. The adorable chocolate spoons begin life as dessert spoons in a discount store like Marshall's before ending up as part of this treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot Chocolate Hacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're time challenged and wondering&amp;nbsp;how to make hot chocolate for kids&amp;nbsp;in a hurry, remember these quick tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melt chocolate ice cream. Yes, it's all the same: milk + cream + chocolate = yum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop a chocolate truffle into hot milk and enjoy the divine creation that results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img width="600" height="400" text="Two Young Girls Learning How to Make Hot Chocolate for Kids" alt="Two Young Girls Learning How to Make Hot Chocolate for Kids" src="/Media/Default/Images/Two%20Young%20Girls%20Learning%20How%20to%20Make%20Hot%20Chocolate%20for%20Kids.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Hot Chocolate Bar for Kids Will Make You a Legend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the holidays, you can turn hot chocolate into more than a beverage by coming up with&amp;nbsp;hot chocolate bar ideas for kids. Make the occasion a simple after school get together for your kids and their friends or an even bigger party for an extended family get together. Whatever you decide, start with decorating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through your holiday decorations to see what will work for your hot chocolate bar, then pick up some fun plaid table runners and scarves at the dollar store for your base layer. Glass mugs can also be found at the dollar store and be used for other events, cutting down on waste. Use a cutting board in the hot chocolate creation station to contain spillage from any overexcited hot chocolate crafters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other items you'll need before you get to the yummy stuff include napkins, plates, and stir sticks or spoons. Why not make the spoons part of the fun of a hot chocolate bar for kids by offering&amp;nbsp;candy canes as&amp;nbsp;spoons or by dipping wooden spoons in chocolate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you've decorated and taken care of tableware, it's time to decide what toppings and treats to offer. Here are some popular choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marshmallows (both mini and large, in a variety of flavors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, butterscotch chips...you get the idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Candy canes &amp;ndash; whole for stirring, crushed for sprinkles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caramel &amp;ndash; sauce and caramel bits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toffee bits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretzel sticks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolate syrup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whipped Cream (The can is easiest, but fresh is tastiest.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprinkles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookies (A non-chocolate variety like Snickerdoodles might be a good choice.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brownies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These add-ins and treats will bring your hot chocolate bar ideas to life, but to blow their minds, you need&amp;nbsp;hot chocolate bombs&amp;nbsp;on your table. You can make or buy these hot chocolate bombs, just be sure you have them on offer if you&amp;rsquo;re not planning on making a big pot of hot chocolate beforehand. Hot chocolate bombs are shiny chocolate balls filled with hot chocolate mix, marshmallows, and extras like chocolate candy or peppermint that you submerge in hot milk and are a mess-free way how to make hot chocolate for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your hot chocolate bar ingredients and materials assembled, you must decide where to set up. For a more elaborate gathering to put your hot chocolate bar ideas to the test, a table will probably be best, but for a kids' after school snack fest, a corner of the kitchen will work great. Just make sure you don't crowd your offerings and that everyone has room to choose what he or she wants. Don't forget you'll need room for the slow cooker of hot chocolate and/or carafes of hot milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Edukit for Other Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you corral your family into the kitchen to whip up a new, yummy hot chocolate recipe for kids or you pull off a hot chocolate bar fit for a party at Gatsby's, everyone will love your seasonal offerings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/blog"&gt;Edukit&lt;/a&gt;, a school supply kit company, offers links to more great ideas on activities parents and kids can do together as well as healthy snack ideas.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img width="600" height="400" text="Keeping Your Kids Healthy in School" alt="Keeping Your Kids Healthy in School" src="/Media/Default/Images/Keeping%20Your%20Kids%20Healthy%20in%20School.jpg" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the school year now in full swing, cold and flu season has swept in on its coattails. Kids who filled the summer months playing outside or in limited groups now spend their days inside. Elementary classrooms average&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/tables/sass1112_2013314_t1s_007.asp"&gt;&amp;nbsp;22 students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;while middle schools and high schools pack 25 kids or more.&amp;nbsp; Under these conditions, the average elementary student will pick up&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stlouischildrens.org/health-resources/pulse/preventing-illness-when-kids-go-back-school"&gt;five to six&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;viruses per school year, and an adolescent will average four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students, both large and small, have little personal space in the average classroom. When one student sneezes or coughs, their germs almost certainly spread to several others around them. Parents often complain that their children seem&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;always to be getting sick since starting school,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;calling it the "back to school plague."&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;So, what can a parent do to prevent those germs from turning into a full-blown illness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Dose of Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to experts, the best way to teach your kids to prevent illness comes by way of good modeling at home. When kids see their parents constantly practicing good hygiene, they will automatically do it at school and be much less likely to pick up germs. For example, when parents&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/health-tip/new-school-year-new-germs-how-manage-frequent-illness-school-year"&gt;sneeze into their elbows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;and practice diligent and proper hand washing, students will follow suit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bad as the discomfort of illness might be, homework piling up because of school absences can be just as hard for a child to deal with when they are feeling better again. With younger kids, one parent must take time off to stay home if he or she works in-person. Clearly, germs can wreak chaos if they find a way in, so wise parents diligently guard against their progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys to Staying Upright When Everyone Else is Dropping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factors other than preventing the spread of germs play key roles in keeping kids healthy. Parents must also focus on these key elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure kids get plenty of sleep: kids between the ages of 6 and 12 need 9 to 12 hours of sleep per night, while teens need 8 to 10 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep stress at a minimum: watch for signs of anxiety, such as changes in eating or sleeping. Allow kids to choose their own extracurricular activities, and keep those activities manageable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep vaccinations up to date: be especially mindful of influenza and COVID-19 shots. Students heading to college should get the&amp;nbsp;Meningococcal vaccine before setting foot in their dorm's close quarters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that children eat a healthy diet: as soon as their child begins solid food, some parents offer only healthy choices. They serve up fruits and vegetables, yogurt, and whole grains, and limit sugary drinks and snacks. By doing this, parents help kids develop lifelong good eating habits, which boosts kids' immune system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is That an Illness I See Before Me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a parent's best efforts, those persistent germs will sometimes still infect kids. How does a parent know &lt;strong&gt;whether to&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;send them to school with a cold&lt;/strong&gt;? Parents must consider not only their own child's well-being, but whether their student is contagious. In general, experts agree on the following&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-childcare-guidance.html#:~:text=People%20who%20have%20symptoms%20of,as%20possible%20after%20symptoms%20begin"&gt;guidelines&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;when making the decision about keeping a child home or sending them to school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever: physicians recommend that students with a temperature of &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+high+should+my+child%27s+fever+be+to+keep+home+from+school&amp;amp;oq=how+high+should+my+child%27s+fever+be+to+kee&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j33i160l3j33i299l2j33i22i29i30l2.18181j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;100.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+high+should+my+child%27s+fever+be+to+keep+home+from+school&amp;amp;oq=how+high+should+my+child%27s+fever+be+to+kee&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j33i160l3j33i299l2j33i22i29i30l2.18181j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;or above should stay home from school.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent cough or congestion that is not caused by allergies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students in high school who aren&amp;rsquo;t feeling well should follow the same guidelines about when to stay home. However, elementary school kids and teenagers require different levels of parental care. While most teenagers can look after themselves with frequent check-ins, younger students need a parent with them during their illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Mountain of Makeup Work: Avoiding Relapse&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers often excuse makeup work in the youngest students, while older elementary kids can usually catch up fairly quickly. The real quandary lies at the feet of high schoolers, who often face mounds of makeup work missed during their absence.&amp;nbsp; These students can easily become sleep deprived, tirelessly trying to catch up, putting them at risk of remaining sick longer or catching something else. To avoid this, parents should work with teachers to create a manageable makeup work schedule.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Serious About Keeping Them Healthy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality remains that when parents send their kids to school, most of those kids will contract a virus simply from being in such close proximity to their peers. But diligent parents can make a difference, reducing the number of viruses their child contracts. Smart parents remember these guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy each child their own school supply kit, such as an &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/program"&gt;Edukit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and discourage passing around utensils. Instead, encourage kids to ask their teachers for spare materials if they run out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach kids how to sneeze and cough into elbows or tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice washing hands with little ones, using an appropriate amount of soap and length of time. A great tip is to teach them to sing a song, like the happy birthday tune, to know how long to wash for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep kids home when they are sick.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world returned to a relatively normal state, and COVID-19 ceased to be the only virus on people's minds, kids went back to the classroom. The common cold joined them, as did strep throat and tonsillitis, the flu, and stomach bugs. School nurses everywhere spend their days calling parents to pick up sick students, but with a bit of prevention, parents' phones don't have to ring quite as often.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/keep-your-kids-healthy-this-school-year/</guid></item><item><title>Easy Fall-Themed Snacks to Make with Your Kids | EduKit</title><link>https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/easy-fall-themed-snacks-to-make-with-your-kids/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weather begins to cool, leaves start to change color and fall to the ground, and parents and kids alike slowly begin to return indoors from long days spent outside basking in the sun, many families start looking for creative ways to keep themselves entertained while cooped up inside and without relying on too much screentime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooking requires a lot of measuring and helps your kids learn different measurements &amp;ndash; like cups, teaspoons, tablespoons &amp;ndash; and they&amp;rsquo;ll use fractions and addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division when cooking. And we can all agree that learning fractions by measuring spoons of sugar is a much more fun way to teach than writing numbers out on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...Improves their language development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you cook, you expand your child&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary because you&amp;rsquo;re not using everyday words. You also label every ingredient, go over every step involved, have your child follow directions, and explain things in ways they can understand, all of which promote language skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...Boosts their fine motor skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixing ingredients, rolling out the dough, and using cookie cutters are amazing ways to increase your child&amp;rsquo;s fine motor skills and sense of their own strength and control. Choosing treats to make with customization options, like rainbow salads, cookie decorating, or funny face sandwiches, is a great way to practice motor skills while having fun with the kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...Advances their reading skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have your kids help read recipes, instructions, and ingredient lists to you to help them practice reading aloud. As they get older, you can ask them to read instructions out loud and then follow them to improve their reading comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...Introduces them to science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking involves quite a bit of science. What happens when certain ingredients are mixed? What happens if too much or too little of an ingredient is used? Get your kids to witness these reactions and try to predict what will happen too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...Improves their focus and attention span&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking requires focus and attention, and it helps your kids to build up these traits. If they&amp;rsquo;re not doing either, their treat might not turn out. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to have fun and be a little silly in the kitchen with the kids. Presenting cooking and baking as an activity that you enjoy will allow your kids to feel the same and therefore keep them more focused and engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...Teaches them important life skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking is a life skill that&amp;rsquo;s important for independence as we grow older. Set your kids up for success by teaching them everything from pouring their own glass of milk to making a sandwich to cooking an entire dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fall Themed Snacks to Make with Your Kids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know just how much of a positive impact cooking can have on your child&amp;rsquo;s development, it&amp;rsquo;s time to cover the reason we&amp;rsquo;re all here &amp;ndash; our favorite fall themed snacks for kids! These easy fall treats for kids will soon become some of your family&amp;rsquo;s favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you head to an apple orchard to go apple picking as a family, get apples at your local farmers market, or pick some up at the grocery store, these are our favorite fall themed snacks for kids that use apples!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Crisp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect fall treat! Chop up apples, and create a yummy filling with cinnamon, brown sugar, white sugar, oatmeal, flour, and butter, bake, and voila! Apple crisps are a fun breakfast treat and a delicious afterschool snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caramel Apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caramel apples are a staple fall treat but make them easier to eat by slicing up the apple before dipping it into the caramel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apples with peanut butter teeth &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slice apples vertically and spread peanut butter on each slice. Next, place de-shelled sunflower seeds in the peanut butter along the top and bottom sides of the apple to make it look like teeth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple nachos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut apples up into small and thin slices and spread them on a plate. Drizzle with honey, peanut butter, and/or chocolate, and top with anything you&amp;rsquo;d like! We suggest chocolate chips, raisins, and any nuts that your family enjoys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple pinwheels &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De-core an apple, then fill it with a mixture of peanut butter, honey, and mini-chocolate chips, then slice the apple into thin slices horizontally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headed to the pumpkin patch and want to use your pumpkins for more than carving? These easy fall treats for kids are sure to be a hit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roasted Pumpkin Seeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the seeds while you&amp;rsquo;re carving your pumpkin for a yummy and nutritious snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pumpkin Dip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use pumpkin puree combined with your other favorite dipping ingredients to make a sweet &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; savory dip! You can use chips or other veggies in this yummy treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pumpkin Chili &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make pumpkin puree and add it to your favorite chili recipe to give your chili a sweet and earthy kick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pumpkin Pancakes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin pancakes are a hit for any meal of the day! Again, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to make pumpkin puree first, then add it to your favorite pancake recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pumpkin Pie Bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin pie bites are like pumpkin pie&amp;hellip; but better because they&amp;rsquo;re bite sized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some of our other favorite snacks for those who want to expand beyond pumpkins and apples&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caramel Corn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinnamon Sugar Tortilla Chips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candied Pecans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kale Chips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peanut Butter Cups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honey Nut Granola Bars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maple Granola Parfait&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinnamon Rolls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White Chocolate Cranberry Cookies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zucchini Bread &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are countless activities that you can do with your kids &amp;ndash; who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a good puzzle or boardgame &amp;ndash; creating homemade decorations for the upcoming holidays, or simply revisiting some long-forgotten books and toys that have been waiting to be played with since spring &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s just something about Autumn that always encourages us to spend a little more time in the kitchen. From cooking dinner to baking cookies, to whipping up some easy to make small snacks, as summer fades into fall, we always love spending a little more time cooking and making warm and hearty meals together. We hope you enjoy making these fall themed snacks for kids with your family too!&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/easy-fall-themed-snacks-to-make-with-your-kids/</guid></item><item><title>How Teaching Your Child to Ride a Bike Pays Off</title><link>https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/how-teaching-your-child-to-ride-a-bike-pays-off/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="600" height="400" title="Tips for Teaching Kids to Ride a Bike" alt="Tips for Teaching Kids to Ride a Bike" src="/Media/Default/Images/Tips%20for%20Teaching%20Kids%20to%20Ride%20a%20Bike.jpg" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching kids to ride a bike ranks among the top duties of parenting, whether you live in the suburbs or a city. Who can fail to remember that scared-excited feeling of their first solo bike ride, sans-training wheels? Mom or Dad gripped the seat, promising to trot along beside you as long as you needed. You inevitably crashed at some point, but you also inevitably learned to ride. That feeling of staying upright, of balancing and propelling yourself forward meant that you had harnessed your own power and gained some independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biking Makes You Stronger and Smarter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to ride a bike teaches kids important skills and sharpens their development. It hones both large and fine motor skills, helps develop hand-eye coordination, and requires advanced thought processes -- including making predictions and problem solving. Plus, biking provides kids with a fun activity to do that has nothing to do with screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, when parents teach their kids to ride a bike, they set them up with a mode of transportation for the rest of their lives. Biking provides autonomy and independence, which is especially important for teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Question of When&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of when to teach a kid to ride a bike always arises soon after they&amp;rsquo;ve left their toddler stages. But before shopping for a preschooler&amp;rsquo;s first bicycle, &lt;a href="https://www.superhealthykids.com/teaching-toddlers-to-ride-a-bike/"&gt;you should consider these questions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can your child respond to directions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can your child pedal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your child show a true interest in riding a bike?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer to all these questions is yes, your kid might be ready for their first bike. On your shopping trip, choose a bicycle that's the appropriate size &amp;ndash; most likely a 14- or 16-inch to start. To test for correct fit, check to see if your child's feet touch the ground with legs straight when they're sitting on the seat. If you can afford it, choose a lighter bike and get one that brakes by pedaling backwards. Handbrakes tend to distract new riders who need to concentrate on the process of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Down to the Nitty Gritty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure that the training wheels make the bike wobble a bit. This might seem counter-intuitive, but remember that bike riding requires balance. Establishing from the beginning that your child must lean a bit one way or the other to balance the bike will serve them well in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, not all parents choose to go the training wheels route. Balance bikes, a new method of teaching how to ride, are gaining more popularity every year. Balance bikes lack pedals, so kids as young as two-years-old can learn to push themselves along, eventually building up momentum and balancing as they lift their feet, propelled by motion. Once mastered, the transition to a pedal bike goes much more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Safety First&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing safety rules should be a priority, so demonstrate this by having your kid pick out a helmet along with their bike. Correct fit of the helmet means a safe child, so take some time to get it right by &lt;a href="https://www.twowheelingtots.com/kids-bike-helmet-sizes-guide/"&gt;following these steps&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove any thick ponytails, headbands, or other accessories before trying on a helmet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place the helmet squarely on top of your kid's head; it should rest about two inches above their eyebrows and be snug but not uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you buckle, adjust the tension on the back of the helmet. If no tension wheel exists, look to see if the helmet comes with extra pads to customize the fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the shake test: with the helmet unbuckled, have your child shake their head to see if the helmet stays in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Over Here, Over There?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helmeted and in possession of the right bicycle, you might think you hear neighborhood sidewalks and bike paths calling to you and your progeny. But safety experts agree that a traffic-free, paved area that is large, flat, and smooth &amp;ndash; such as a tennis or basketball court &amp;ndash; is easier and safer to learn on. Once there, have your child practice getting on and off several times. You'll also want to help your kid practice braking before they actually need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you know it, your child will be nagging you constantly to ride their bike, and they will abandon the training wheels in favor of speed. Riding bikes together counts as one of the ultimate family activities, and as summer winds down, families can squeeze in not only a few more bike rides but also &lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/blog/family-activities-to-do-before-school-begins"&gt;these fun suggestions from EduKit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Look Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/"&gt;EduKit&lt;/a&gt;, which offers families bundled school supplies in custom kits, offers parents advice on a range of topics like "&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/blog/how-to-get-your-children-back-into-a-school-routine"&gt;How to Get Your Children Back Into a School Routine&lt;/a&gt;," and "&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/blog/spread-school-spirit-with-personalized-school-planners/"&gt;Spread the School Spirit With Personalized School Planners.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before the school bell rings to signal the beginning of a new academic year, approximately&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/985990/participation-kids-cycling/#:~:text=Share%20of%20participants%20in%20children's%20cycling%20in%20the%20U.S.%202020&amp;amp;text=According%20to%20the%20source%2C%2017,from%2027.7%20percent%20in%202008."&gt;795,600 five-year-olds&lt;/a&gt; will add their names to the long list of bicyclists. A parent's investment in their child as a cyclist will pay dividends for decades. And maybe one day, when you're least expecting it, your little bicyclist will say thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/how-teaching-your-child-to-ride-a-bike-pays-off/</guid></item><item><title>EduKit - Student Athletics and Picking Afterschool Activities</title><link>https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/helping-your-kids-choose-fun-afterschool-activities/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="600" height="400" title="Choosing Fun Afterschool Activities" alt="Choosing Fun Afterschool Activities" src="/Media/Default/Images/Choosing%20Fun%20Afterschool%20Activities.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parents, we often think back fondly to our school years. The best parts were often when we finished our classes, and the fun began at various after-school sports and clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After-school activities for our kids are a great way for them to develop important life skills in a fun and rewarding environment. After-school activities can even help them spend less time on their electronic devices and more time developing important, in-person relationships with their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern workplace, you will find that academic success is not the only yardstick that recruiters use to assess potential employees. Soft skills learned in environments like afterschool activities often are just as important as academic achievement. These after-school clubs and teams held at your child&amp;rsquo;s school help develop soft skills like teamwork, time management, ability to take criticism, flexibility, communication, and many more important skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when school starts, have your child consider signing up for a sports team or club that interests them. Afterschool activities help your child to develop a healthy mix of soft skills, teach them how to play a lifelong sport, find a new hobby in their favorite club and even make new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sports have a lot of benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Children-And-Sports-061.aspx#:~:text=Sports%20and%20Children&amp;amp;text=Sports%20help%20children%20develop%20physical,become%20a%20money%2Dmaking%20business."&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that the importance of after-school sports can&amp;rsquo;t be underestimated. Sports are vital when it comes to your student&amp;rsquo;s social, emotional, and mental well-being, and physical development. They might not be for everyone, but they have been shown to have a major impact on our youth. They can decrease stress, anxiety, and depression, while increasing self-esteem and confidence, all at a time when your child needs it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other important advantages gained from participating in sports are the improvements in cardiovascular fitness, the development of important skill sets like teamwork, self-control, and sportsmanship, improved social skills, and the fun had while playing on a team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of sports that your child or teen can choose from year-round. Having your child choose their favorite helps make the activity enjoyable and takes some of the pressure out of playing. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what sport your child chooses as long as they enjoy themselves. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of sports that your school may offer include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soccer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Football&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gymnastics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baseball / Softball&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swim team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clubs Give Students a Chance to Explore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those students that are less interested in sports, they still have plenty of options for afterschool activities! They provide a safe, structured environment where they are challenged in new and exciting ways that are very different from the classroom structure they are so used to. Since schools offer many choices for clubs, your child should choose one that sparks their interest, whether it&amp;rsquo;s an activity they&amp;rsquo;ve done before or they&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning something new. Clubs should be all about enjoyment, and when your child is having fun in their afternoon activity, they are also learning valuable skillsets that will benefit them later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clubs allow for participation in a supervised, constructive environment where interests can be developed in a fun social way. Some clubs have expectations regarding attendance that can build your student&amp;rsquo;s reliability and responsibility. Clubs such as Robotics, Coding, or Cooking have a long-lasting impact by building career experiences and job skills that are useful later on. Chess or Debate clubs teach critical and strategic thinking. Band, Choir, or Drama allow students to develop their creative sides. Other clubs such as the Gardening or Nature Club may drive awareness and develop new hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of experiences gained by participation in clubs that have a lasting impact on your child. What is important is that your student chooses an activity that they enjoy &amp;ndash; something that is fun for them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while your child takes part in their favorite after-school activity, and you&amp;rsquo;re focused on the logistics of carpooling, let Edukit worry about their &lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/online-school-supplies"&gt;school supplies kit&lt;/a&gt;. You can count on Edukit to deliver the right school supplies for your student, and you will get the peace of mind that comes with knowing your student is ready for anything both inside the classroom and during their afterschool activities&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/helping-your-kids-choose-fun-afterschool-activities/</guid></item><item><title>Top 5 Fourth of July Activities to Do with Your Kids</title><link>https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/top-5-best-ways-to-celebrate-4th-of-July-with-kids/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="600" height="400" title="Fourth of July Activities to Do with Your Kids" alt="Fourth of July Activities to Do with Your Kids" src="/Media/Default/Images/Fourth%20of%20July%20Activities%20to%20Do%20with%20Your%20Kids.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the end of the school year tells us that summer has officially begun, then the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July means the middle of Summer has rolled around. The magic of fireflies light up the night sky and barbecuing with family and friends has just hit top gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the kids might be asking what&amp;rsquo;s next in your big summer plans. Or maybe they are getting restless and bored with the lack of school. Celebrating the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July is a great way to get your kids involved with family activities and outdoors for a day full of fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five fun ideas of activities that include the kids for the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch a Parade&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July activity during the day sets the scene for the excitement of the evening. Before the fireworks take flight, take your family to watch a parade. There&amp;rsquo;s no better way to take part in the community spirit and enjoy your children&amp;rsquo;s excitement than watching a 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July parade and waving the red, white and blue. The kids will enjoy the music from the fife and drum corps as well as the military and school marching bands, led by the drum major and the drill teams. Patriot enactors tramp down the street with their cocked hats and muskets. There are decorated floats, enormous character balloons, dancers and acrobats tumbling about, sure to excite the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might even get lucky enough to collect some sweet treats, as many parade floats like to toss candy or hand out popsicles as they pass by. Parents watching sugar consumption, be warned!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a Water Fight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another activity to do before the fireworks begin is have a water fight. Kids love water, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a slip &amp;lsquo;n slide, sprinkler, or pool. Water is guaranteed to brighten up any kid&amp;rsquo;s mood and cool them off on this hot summer day. Hand out the water toys &amp;ndash; the water guns and balloons and then run. Make sure you have swimsuits ready and get prepared to get wet. Join in the fun or take the opportunity to sit down in a chair with a cold drink and enjoy the pandemonium.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summer Means Baseball&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is summer without baseball? Take your kids to watch a major league game or check your neighborhood for a local game. If there&amp;rsquo;s nothing close by, then play baseball at the park. Make it a family and friends event where you invite your children&amp;rsquo;s playmates and their parents. Not sure of the rules? Not to worry. Haggling over whether that runner made the base in time or whether it was an out makes it all the more enjoyable for everyone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook up a Feast&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inviting friends and neighbors for an evening barbecue outside is also a great 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July activity. Grill hot dogs and burgers either at home or at your local park. Make it a potluck and enjoy great sides like coleslaw, potato or macaroni salad and your favorite summertime fruit. Then finish your meal with some patriotic red, white and blue cupcakes. Get the kids involved in decorating the cupcakes beforehand as part of the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July festivity. No need to be fancy. Simple is best. And messy is even better&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img width="600" height="400" title="Kids Enjoying Sparklers on The Fourth of July" alt="Kids Enjoying Sparklers on The Fourth of July" src="/Media/Default/Images/Kids%20Enjoying%20Sparklers%20on%20The%20Fourth%20of%20July.jpg" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;5.&lt;strong&gt; Light up the Night&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a great place to watch the fireworks. It could be on top of a building, a hill or even your local park. Bring a blanket, earplugs for the little ones, and get ready to &lt;em&gt;ooh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;aah&lt;/em&gt;. The fireworks exploding around, the gigantic falling flowers, the vibrant colors and the spectacular patterns are always astonishing. If you can&amp;rsquo;t get to the fireworks in person, the spectacular shows from New York, Washington DC, Chicago or San Diego will be just the ticket. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to get sparklers for the kids to wave around in the dark or bang snaps to play with on the sidewalk. These wonderful memories of summer and the Fourth of July will stay with your children long after they are back at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to enjoy every minute of summer, because when back-to-school starts to roll around again and you need to start thinking of school supply shopping, Edukit has your back.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 17:06:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/top-5-best-ways-to-celebrate-4th-of-July-with-kids/</guid></item><item><title>Teachers Save Money with Custom School Supply Kits</title><link>https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/turn-your-school-supply-lists-into-kits/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img width="600" height="400" title="Turn Your School Supply Lists into Custom Kits" alt="Turn Your School Supply Lists into Custom Kits" src="/Media/Default/Images/Turn%20Your%20School%20Supply%20Lists%20into%20Custom%20Kits.jpg" /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that teachers are everyday heroes. From all the hours that are poured into the preparation of lesson plans, to managing various types of behavior, to working tirelessly with beloved students to provide them with the education they need for success in life. Most everyone can, and should, recognize that teachers have a lot on their plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where teachers don&amp;rsquo;t receive enough credit is when they provide school supplies to the students who don&amp;rsquo;t have them, either because they don&amp;rsquo;t have the correct materials, or they simply are missing them. It can be a struggle for parents to match exact materials, especially for supplies they haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of before or when stores are all out of the supplies they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.adoptaclassroom.org/2021/07/29/how-much-do-teachers-spend-on-supplies/"&gt;survey done in 2021&lt;/a&gt; by AdoptaClassroom.org, the data revealed that about 95% of teachers from all over the USA say that their class supplies budget does not meet the needs of their students throughout the school year. In fact, 65% of educators say their biggest obstacle to a productive classroom environment was students having the appropriate school supplies. Without the right supplies, many students may have a difficult time succeeding in the classroom and could fall behind theirs. In this survey, the teachers conceded that they spend an average of $750.00 on school materials out-of-pocket to provide equity to all their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where school kit programs, like those found at Edukit, can assist. Using the teacher&amp;rsquo;s supply lists, Edukit creates custom kits available for parents to purchase. The teacher receives exactly what they wanted and the parents have an easy option to ensure their child is well prepared for class. EduKit works with the school to ensure the kits meet the teacher's specific school supply list needs, whether they place importance on brands or on quality value items for schools that are budget-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKit even has options to help set up fundraising programs for the school to help raise funds that the school can allocate throughout the school year to further support their students. Or, if the school has allocated funds for school supplies, a program can be set up with the school itself. Teachers can rest easy knowing that classroom equity has been achieved with regards to every student having the materials they need to succeed. It&amp;rsquo;s a win-win for everybody!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, talk to your school and encourage them to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/school-information"&gt;sign up for Edukit&amp;rsquo;s custom school supply kits&lt;/a&gt; to ensure your classroom gets exactly what is needed to start the school year right.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 19:58:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/turn-your-school-supply-lists-into-kits/</guid></item><item><title>Spread the School Spirit with Personalized School Planners</title><link>https://www.edukitinc.com:443/blog/spread-school-spirit-with-personalized-school-planners/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img width="600" height="400" title="Ensuring Student Success with Personalized School Planners" alt="Ensuring Student Success with Personalized School Planners" src="/Media/Default/Images/Ensuring%20Student%20Success%20with%20Personalized%20School%20Planners%20(1).jpg" /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planners are an important part of teaching children organization and helping set them up for success in school. Planners help elementary and middle school students keep track of their assignments, plan for important dates, and develop important organization skills. They encourage productivity, goal setting, and community. But perhaps more significantly, schools can inspire school spirit when they customize their planner with mascots, important events, documents, calendars, and announcements relevant to your school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization Made Easy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalized school planners are a visual cue for keeping on top of assignments. They reduce student stress because all the assignments are in one place. This is great for developing organizational habits and leads to increased productivity when used consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planners are an essential tool to help students organize their school lives. Our planners can be customized to make organization fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Great Tool For Productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When students have a calendar with all their deadlines and events, their productivity increases, and they are more prepared. This helps lead to less procrastination and cramming, helping your student achieve academically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Goals Fresh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many teachers encourage students to set goals, either behavioral or academic. Students write them down in their &lt;a href="https://www.edukitinc.com/student-planners"&gt;personalized school planners&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to see them constantly. This helps build good habits and set them up to achieve their goals. If parents can see the goals too, they naturally become part of a discussion which can be very motivating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication Is Clear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personalized school planner helps keep the line of communication between parents, students, and teachers open. Letters home can be tucked into vinyl pockets. For parents who are not very tech-savvy, important information is easy to see in one place and easy to find. A personalized calendar has all the school functions, vacations, holidays, and important testing days. A planner can clarify if there was homework for a particular class. And not every student wants to tell their parents when there is a teacher open house coming up. So, parents will find the planners useful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customizable for All Grades&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every grade level needs its own set of items to be included in a planner. As students progress through school, they will have more structure to their day and might need more space in their planners for tracking assignments and upcoming testing days. These are all things that can be customized to meet your school&amp;rsquo;s unique needs. A personalized school planner can help ease the transition and teach them time management habits that extend on into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized School Planners Are Beneficial for The School Too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Kindergarten high school, personalized planners are extremely useful. The content and format can be tailored according to their needs and requirements. Specific school policies can be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many schools have an interpretation of a Student&amp;rsquo;s Rights and Responsibilities (SR&amp;amp;R) document, which details expectations for students and the code of conduct for behavior and the use of digital resources. If the SR&amp;amp;R is included as part of the planner, then it is accessible. A signature page can be included for students and parents, which makes it much easier to collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planners Last The Whole Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students are hard on their backpacks and are always slinging them around or dropping them on the floor. What is good to know is that the personalized school planners are durable and should survive any rough treatment. Sturdy cardstock covers ensure that they don&amp;rsquo;t get ripped off easily. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EduKit&amp;rsquo;s personalized school planners make everyone&amp;rsquo;s life easier and spread a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;
